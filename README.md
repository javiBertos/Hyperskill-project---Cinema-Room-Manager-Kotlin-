# [Hyperskill project] Cinema Room Manager (Kotlin)
This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Kotlin. You will deal with lists and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.

## About
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

#### STAGE 1/5 Arrangement
Visualize the seating arrangement by printing it to the console.

#### STAGE 2/5 Sold!
Calculate the profit from all the sold tickets.

#### STAGE 3/5 Tickets
Set the ticket price.

#### STAGE 4/5 Menu, please!
Add a menu that allows you to buy tickets and display the current state of the seating arrangement.

#### STAGE 5/5 Error!
Handle some input errors.

## Graduate project
This project covers the core topics of the Introduction to Kotlin course, making it sufficiently challenging to be a proud addition to your portfolio.
